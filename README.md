## 🔍 Overview
The **Network Bandwidth Monitoring Tool** is a Python-based application designed to monitor and display real-time network usage. The tool is capable of functioning in both GUI (Graphical User Interface) and headless (command-line) environments.


### Key Features:
- **Real-time monitoring** of upload and download speeds.
- **Human-readable format** for network statistics (KB, MB, GB, TB).
- **GUI support** using `tkinter` for easy visualization.
- **Console support** for headless systems.
- **Cross-platform** compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS).


## 🛠️ Functional Requirements:
1. **Network Statistics Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of bytes sent and received using the `psutil` library.
2. **Human-readable Output**: Display data in easily understandable formats (e.g., KB, MB).
3. **Real-time Updates**: Continuous updates every 1.5 seconds.
4. **User Interface**:
   - **GUI Mode**: For systems with a display.
   - **Console Mode**: For headless (non-GUI) environments.


## 🚀 How to Run the Tool:
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.x installed.
   - Libraries: `psutil`, `tkinter`.

2. **Running in GUI Mode**:
   ```bash
   python network_monitor.py
